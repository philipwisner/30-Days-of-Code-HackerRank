//DAY 1: DATA TYPES

//Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
//Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
//Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
//Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
//Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
//Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

function main() {
	var i = 4;
	var d = 4.0;
	var s = "HackerRank "
	// Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
    var int;
    var double;
    var string;
    // Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
    int = parseInt(readLine()) + i;
    double = parseFloat(readLine()) + d;
    string = s + readLine();
    // Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
    console.log(int);
    // Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
    console.log(double.toFixed(1));
    // Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
    // The 's' variable above should be printed first.
    console.log(string);
